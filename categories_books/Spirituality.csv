Looking for answers to todayâs wrenching challenges, William Martin turns to the Tao Te Ching and finds that while Taoism is known for its quiet, enigmatic wisdom, the Tao can also have the cleansing force of a rushing river.Through his interpretation of this ancient Chinese text, Martin elucidates revolutionary messages condemning power-seeking and greed. He emphasizes that humans have a ânatural virtueâ that can help them heal the planet; shows how Taoismâs simplicity can be subversive and its flexibility a potent force; and reassures that âwhen injustice is the rule, justice always lies in wait.âProvocative and stirring, Martinâs Tao flows within and through those who ride the waves of anger and frustration and gently guides them to true freedom.âWe have learned the secret of transformation: Injustice feeds our determination. Hate increases our love. Wounds bring forth our healing, and fear uncovers our courage and serenity.ââ from The Activistâs Tao Te Ching ...more"

They all feel strongly about who or what they think God is, why things happen the way they do, and what will become of us in the future. They question, praise and criticize God in the hopes of better understanding themselves and others. In a world challenged by economic issues, climate change, war, and constant threat of terrorism, people are pausing from their daily routines to ask the deeper questions and wonder about the divine and mysterious nature of their Creator.In this book, author and spiritual seeker Mare Cromwell interviews people from all walks of life, asking, âIf I gave you Godâs phone number, what would you do with it?â This spiritual memoir, framed by twenty-one interviews with people from all walks of life, combines the oral tradition of Studs Terkel with the soulful searchings of Neale Donald Welsh. If I gave you Godâs phone numberâ¦ offers the reader what only the best books offerâwindows into the most authentic reaches of the soul. Cromwellâs conscientious selection of interview subjects, and her deft questioning, which presses them to go deeper and deeper, is what lends the book its striking range. This diorama of spiritual posturesâsome passionate, some highly intellectualizedâis impossible to look away from, infects the reader with a fever of curiosity about the human condition, and then proceeds to administer the careful cure: vivid, compelling testimony. Not only do her many subjects nourish the reader by their telling, but Cromwell too provides ongoing doses of self-revelation, a gesture of honesty that unifies and strengthens the whole picture.
